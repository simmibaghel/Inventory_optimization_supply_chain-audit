# Inventory Optimization & Logistics Analysis 📦

## 📌 Project Overview
Inefficient inventory management leads to high carrying costs and lost sales due to stockouts. This project applied data-driven optimization techniques to streamline supply chain operations, resulting in a **12% reduction in annual carrying costs** and achieving a **97% on-time distribution rate**.

## 🎯 Key Objectives
* **Safety Stock Optimization:** Developed a dynamic model to calculate inventory buffers based on demand volatility and supplier lead times.
* **Root Cause Analysis (RCA):** Identified critical bottlenecks in the fulfillment process that led to a 15% delay in regional deliveries.
* **Cost Reduction:** Minimized "Dead Stock" by identifying low-turnover items through ABC Analysis (Categorizing inventory by value/importance).

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Python:** SciPy (Optimization), Pandas (Data Wrangling).
* **SQL:** CTEs and Window Functions for calculating rolling average lead times and stock-to-sales ratios.
* **Power BI:** Logistics Performance Dashboard featuring "Inventory Health" metrics.

## 📊 Methodology
1.  **Demand Profiling:** Used SQL to segment products into A, B, and C categories based on their contribution to total revenue.
2.  **Lead Time Analysis:** Calculated the variance in supplier performance to adjust safety stock levels dynamically rather than using a static "one-size-fits-all" number.
3.  **Fulfillment RCA:** Performed a deep-dive analysis into shipping data, discovering that 60% of delays occurred at a specific transit hub.

## 📈 Key Results
* **97% On-Time Distribution:** By re-routing high-priority shipments based on logistics bottleneck insights.
* **12% Carrying Cost Savings:** Optimized order cycles using the **Economic Order Quantity (EOQ)** model.
* **Inventory Accuracy:** Improved stock visibility across multiple warehouse locations using integrated Power BI reporting.
